# Molecules

These items are meant to be a little more complicated/involved than atoms, while still being less than a full component on their own.

If you think about a login page. The username text box is an atom, the entire login form is an organisms, the username input, with field description and label, is a molecule.

**If two items have the same number, they are flagged for merge. They should not stay like that for long.**

No project should go live with two things having the same number. They should either get merged or assigned a new number.

## Numbering

The number picked for a molecule shouldn't be arbitrary. A three digit number is used in so that we can assign broad spaces to use cases and keep those things in the library for use when needed. This way we don't constantly re-use numbers for different uses.
